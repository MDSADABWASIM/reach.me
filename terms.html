<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Order submission</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the User submits an order, the following applies:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been received.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prices</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and costs (including, if any, extra costs) that they will be charged.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We take 10% fee from mentor on every paid meeting purchase (it includes fees took by payment processing service).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prices on this App are displayed:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>excluding any applicable fees, taxes and costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offers and discounts</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sellers may offer discounts or provide special offers for the purchase of Meetings. Any such offer or discount shall always be subject to the eligibility criteria and the terms and conditions set out in the corresponding section of this App.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offers and discounts are always granted at the Mentor's sole discretion. Repeated or recurring offers or discounts create no claim/title or right that Users may enforce in the future. Depending on the case, discounts or offers shall be valid for a limited time only or while stocks last.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coupons</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offers or discounts can be based on Coupons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If breach of the conditions applicable to Coupons occurs, the Seller can legitimately refuse to fulfill its contractual obligations and expressly reserves the right to take appropriate legal action to protect its rights and interests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions below, any additional or diverging rules applicable to using the Coupon displayed in the corresponding information page or on the Coupon itself shall always prevail.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unless otherwise stated, these rules apply to the use of Coupons:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each Coupon is only valid when used in the manner and within the timeframe specified on the App and/or the Coupon;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Coupon may only be applied, in its entirety, at the actual time of purchase - partial use is not permitted;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unless otherwise stated, single-use Coupons may only be used once per purchase and therefore may only be applied a single time even in cases involving installment-based purchases;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Coupon cannot be applied cumulatively;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coupon must be redeemed exclusively within the time specified in the offer. After this period, the Coupon will automatically expire, precluding any possibility for the User to claim the relevant rights, including cash-out;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The User is not entitled to any credit/refund/compensation if there is a difference between the value of the Coupon and the redeemed value;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coupon is intended solely for non-commercial use. Any reproduction, counterfeiting and commercial trade of the Coupon is strictly forbidden, along with any illegal activity related to the purchase and/or use of the Coupon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Methods of payment</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All payments are independently processed through third-party services. Therefore, this App does not collect any payment information - such as credit card details - but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If payment through the available methods fail or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfil the purchase order. Any possible costs or fees resulting from the failed or refused payment shall be borne by the User.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>User rights</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right of withdrawal</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification. Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who the right of withdrawal applies to</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The right of withdrawal is a right designed for European Consumers in the case of distance contracts (because the User is not able to see or try the Products before closing the contract). Withdrawal from the contract terminates the obligation of the contracting parties to perform the contract.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On this App the right of withdrawal applies to all Users.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unless any exception mentioned below applies, if any, Users have a right to withdraw from the contract within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Exercising the right of withdrawal</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the “definitions” section of this document. Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way. In order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regarding the purchase of a service, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Effects of withdrawal</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User’s decision to withdraw from the contract. Unless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction. In any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>…on the purchase of services</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where a User exercises the right of withdrawal after having requested that the service be performed before the withdrawal period expires, the User shall pay to the Owner an amount which is in proportion to the part of service provided.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Such payment shall be calculated based on the fee contractually agreed upon, and be proportional to the part of service provided until the time the User withdraws, compared with the full coverage of the contract.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Exceptions from the right of withdrawal</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The right of withdrawal does not apply to contracts:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>for the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun with the consumer’s prior express consent and with their acknowledgment that their right of withdrawal is thereby lost;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>for the provision of services, after the service has been fully performed if the performance has begun with the consumer’s prior express consent, and with their acknowledgement that their right of withdrawal is lost once the contract has been fully performed;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Liability and indemnification</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Australian Users</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Limitation of liability</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any guarantee, condition, warranty, right or remedy which the User may have under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) or any similar State and Territory legislation and which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified (non-excludable right). To the fullest extent permitted by law, our liability to the User, including liability for a breach of a non-excludable right and liability which is not otherwise excluded under these Terms of Use, is limited, at the Owner’s sole discretion, to the re-performance of the services or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.</p>
